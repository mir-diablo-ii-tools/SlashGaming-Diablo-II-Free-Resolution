  * How to find patch locations:
  * 1. Start a game with any character. Do not open the Game Menu.
  * 2. Set a read breakpoint on D2Client's GeneralDisplayWidth
  *    variable.
  * 3. Move the mouse, click, and interact with as many things as
  *    possible on the screen to trigger code that will be added to
  *    the top of the list. Any breakpoint triggers in this list are
  *    to be ignored.
  * 4. Open the game menu.
  * 5. Select the Options menu. Next, select the Video Options menu.
  * 6. Wait for a bit and then leave the Video Options menu by
  *    selecting the Previous Menu. Do not press the ESC key.
  * 7. At the very bottom of the breakpoint trigger list are 5
  *    opcodes. 3 of them belong to a "set" because they trigger at
  *    the same rate. In other words, their trigger counter value is
  *    the same. There is a second "set" containing the other 2
  *    opcodes.
  * 8. In the second "set", go to the address of the second opcode.
  * 9. Follow the sequence of opcodes to a function call. The patch
  *    address is the opcode immediately preceding the function call.
  * 10. The patch also requires the use of a pointer. This pointer is
  *     determined by the value of one or more of the stack and
  *     registers' values at that point in the code. Open the Video
  *     Options menu and set a breakpoint at the function call.
